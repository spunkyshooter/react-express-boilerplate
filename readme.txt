//Inside the client folder

2. * add proxy is need to be set in client to do requests locally if you donâ€™t wanna type
    * "http//localhost:4000" in every request
    * so add this line in package.json file of client
    *  "proxy": "http://localhost:4000"


3. yarn add react-router-dom node-sass
	- and rename css to scss
4. for ABSOLUTE imports in react
